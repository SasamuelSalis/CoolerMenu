Samuel's Cooler Menu (V1.2)

I got kinda bored with the default Terraria title screen. I looked around for mods that would change it up, but couldn't really find what I was looking for.
So I did what any sane person would do and spent WAY too much time making my own custom menu from scratch!

  Features rn
• Smooth sliding button and (some) menu animations
• Custom background images on button hover (toggleable)
• Choose left/right side for buttons and logo
• Fun splash messages (toggleable) 
• Custom button icons (toggleable)
• It's localized for all languages!!!
• Floating button animations (toggleable)

 How to Use
Download the mod (a duh)

This is my first proper mod, so updates might take a bit to make. I'm still learning! If you have suggestions or find bugs, let me know!

The vanilla menu works fine, but after hundreds of hours it gets a bit... repetitive. This just adds some visual variety without changing how the game actually plays.

Stay cool!
